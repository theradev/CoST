# CoST

A kinetic novel inspired by the Metal Gear card game for PSP.  Actions taken use up CoST points, or constitution. ("health") 

You accept fares for money.  Refusing a ride replenishes CoST and +1 hour passes.  As you take on more work, your character's max CoST expands.  
But every action will advance your age accordingly to how quickly you give your vehicle the beans! ü´ò.  

Work will demand more CoST from you as you get older, so don't forget to ReST! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
Especially the long distance ones, if you push yourself too hard.  

That is, unless you find a balance...


Every 20 hours, your character ReSTs & you learn more about the character.  
Taking rides for more than your existing CoST will incapacitate you & time will advance quadratically unless:
  a.  You meet or exceed 20 hours at the moment of going over-CoST, and/or
  b.  There's 24 hours left in the game.
  
At negative CoST, every action you take will incapacitate you.  You must ReST until you are above 0 + sufficient CoST.

Enjoy!
